Hibernate mapping and query examples
====================================

Contains a number of different examples of Hibernate mappings and queries, such as:

 * Using a join formula to join on one of two columns
 * Accessing an index collection element in HQL
 * Using the "between" keyword

The project is built using Maven, and sets up an HSQLDB to run. Hence, if you have maven installed, to run the examples just type:

    mvn test
